sys_prompt = '''You are a classification model capable of understanding human language, intent, and structure of natural conversation patterns. You are an agent which is capable of classifying interactions. You are to properly follow all instructions below based on only inputs provided to you, and no other information.'''

judge_prompt = '''A set of transcripts between a [USER] and an [AGENT] will be provided. Classify the last turn in the transcript by the [AGENT], which may have multiple sentences. 

Conversation Transcript:
<transcript_with_turn_num>

Classification Labels:
<labels>\n\n

There are also a couple of rules that you MUST follow:

1. Your task is to classify the sentences by the [AGENT] in the last turn. NEVER classify a sentence by the [USER].

2. If the [AGENT]'s response contains multiple sentences, you must classify each sentence. Classify each sentence in the last [AGENT]'s response. If there are multiple sentences, separate each class label with a comma.

3. If the last [AGENT] turn is blank or empty, you must classify it as Silence.

4. You must ignore pauses.

5. Answer with the class label or labels only. Do not include any evidence.

Classify line <last_agent_turn_num> by the [AGENT] using the provided labels.'''

def_expansion_open_request = '''
- Repeat: When AGENT’s last turn (line <last_agent_turn_num>) is a repeat of AGENT’s prior turn (<prior_turn>) using the same words, for example, to resolve USER’s trouble in hearing.  It may be a full or partial repeat of the misheard turn.
- Paraphrase: When AGENT’s last turn (line <last_agent_turn_num>) is a paraphrase of AGENT’s prior turn (<prior_turn>) using different words, for example, to resolve USER’s trouble in understanding. It may be a full or partial paraphrase of the misunderstood turn.
- Example: When AGENT's last turn (line <last_agent_turn_num>) provides an example of a keyword or phrase in AGENT's prior turn (<prior_turn>), for instance, to resolve USER's trouble in understanding that keyword or phrase. For example, an 'Old Fashioned' is an example of a 'classic cocktail'.
- Definition: When AGENT's last turn (line <last_agent_turn_num>) is a definition of a keyword or phrase in AGENT's prior turn (<prior_turn>), for example, to resolve USER's trouble in understanding that keyword or phrase. For example, 'artificial intelligence means technology that enables computers to simulate human reasoning or problem-solving' or 'Chantilly is a kind of sweetened whipped cream'.
- ChoiceGiving: Giving choices to USER for answering a detail request; for example, 'We have tall, grande and venti sizes' or 'We sell gas, charcoal and wood burning grills'.
- OOC: a stance that is not in the voice of the AGENT, but in that of another character, such as an analyst or AI personality, for example, '(Note:' or 'In this improved conversation,' or 'Or, you could say:' or Chain-of-Thought.
- Other: An utterance that does not fit any of the above classes.
